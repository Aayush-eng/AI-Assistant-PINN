# AI-Assistant-PINN

# Introduction
PINN is an simple open-source AI assistant which can be customised 

He does stuff when you ask him for. 

# Why?
If you are a developer (or not), you may want to build many things that could help in your daily life. Instead of building a dedicated project for each of those ideas, PINN can help you with his packages/modules (skills) structure.
With this generic structure, everyone can create their own modules and share them with others. Therefore there is only one core (to rule them all).
PINN uses AI concepts, which is pretty cool & simple.
